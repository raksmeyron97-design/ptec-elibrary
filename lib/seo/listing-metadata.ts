/**
 * Metadata for paginated listing pages (/books, /theses, /posts, …).
 *
 * - Page 1 and deeper pages each get a self-referencing canonical
 *   (`/books`, `/books?page=2`, …) so Google can crawl and index the full
 *   collection instead of collapsing everything onto page 1.
 * - Filtered / searched variants (?q=, ?dept=, ?sort=, …) are kept out of the
 *   index (`noindex, follow`): the links are still crawled, but the
 *   near-duplicate filter permutations don't pollute search results.
 * - Pages beyond the last result page (?page=999) are `noindex, follow` too —
 *   an empty grid is not a useful index entry (pass `outOfRange`).
 * - A listing whose WHOLE collection is empty is `noindex, follow` as well
 *   (pass `isEmpty`). /publications was live, indexable and in the sitemap
 *   while rendering "No publications are currently available" (verified on
 *   production 2026-09-09) — a soft-404 by the same definition that already
 *   keeps empty subjects and empty entity hubs out of the index. This is about
 *   the collection having no rows at all, NOT about a filter matching nothing:
 *   that case is already covered by `hasFilters`.
 * - Every listing gets a social image. `image` is optional, but its DEFAULT is
 *   the site card rather than nothing: /theses, /theses/summary, /catalogs,
 *   /publications and /paths were each shipping with no og:image at all
 *   (verified live 2026-09-07) purely because they did not pass one, so a
 *   share of any of them rendered as a bare link. Detail pages have used this
 *   same fallback since book-seo.ts; a listing had no reason to differ.
